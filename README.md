This application likes to screw with the end user.

For using the application yow will need to put the contents of the File directory in the same directory of the binary

ATTENTION: This application has its source code based on Jerry's (a.k.a Barnacules) code in his Codegasm series, i'm just changing some of the code so i can use it for myself. I'd like to give Jerry all the credits for this mighthy application, thank you. Jerry's Github profile: https://github.com/Barnacules/Codegasm

ATTENTION: I do not own any of the art and music under the Files directory, i just use it for pranks, i give credit for the file's respective creators. 
Music: Mc Bin Laden, Ta Tranquilo Ta favor√°vel : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkJ5Lc0WwVw
