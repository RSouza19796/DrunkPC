This application likes to screw with the end user.

ATTENTION: This application has its source code based on Jerry's (a.k.a Barnacules) code in his Codegasm series, i'm just changing some of the code so i can use it for myself. I'd like to give Jerry all the credits for this mighthy application, thank you.
